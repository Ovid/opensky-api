=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use OpenSky::API;
    my $opensky = OpenSky::API->new;
    my $states  = $opensky->get_states;
    my $state   = $states->[0];
    say $state->callsign;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is not to be instantiated directly. It is a read-only class representing an
L<OpenSky state vector|https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/index.html#state-vectors>.

All attributes are read-only.

=head2 C<icao24>

Unique ICAO 24-bit address of the transponder in hex string representation.

=head2 C<callsign>

Callsign of the vehicle (8 chars). Can be null if no callsign has been received.

=head2 C<origin_country>

Country name inferred from the ICAO 24-bit address.

=head2 C<time_position>

Unix timestamp (seconds) for the last position update. Can be null if no position report was received by OpenSky within the past 15s.

=head2 C<last_contact>

Unix timestamp (seconds) for the last update in general. This field is updated for any new, valid message received from the transponder.

=head2 C<longitude>

WGS-84 longitude in decimal degrees. Can be null.

=head2 C<latitude>

WGS-84 latitude in decimal degrees. Can be null.

=head2 C<baro_altitude>

Barometric altitude in meters. Can be null.

=head2 C<on_ground>

Boolean value which indicates if the position was retrieved from a surface position report.

=head2 C<velocity>

Velocity over ground in m/s. Can be null.

=head2 C<true_track>

True track in decimal degrees clockwise from north (north=0°). Can be null.

=head2 C<vertical_rate>

Vertical rate in m/s. A positive value indicates that the airplane is climbing, a negative value indicates that it descends. Can be null.

=head2 C<sensors>

IDs of the receivers which contributed to this state vector. Is null if no filtering for sensor was used in the request.

=head2 C<geo_altitude>

Geometric altitude in meters. Can be null.

=head2 C<squawk>

The transponder code aka Squawk. Can be null.

=head2 C<spi>

Whether flight status indicates special purpose indicator.


=head2 C<position_source_name>

Returns the name of the position source. Can be an empty string.

=head2 C<position_source>

Integer. Origin of this state’s position:

    0 = ADS-B
    1 = ASTERIX
    2 = MLAT
    3 = FLARM

=head2 C<category_name>

Returns the name of the aircraft category. Can be an empty string.

If C<< $opensky->get_states >> is called without C<extended> set to true, this
method will always return an empty string.

=head2 C<category>

Integer. Aircraft category. Can be null.

    0 = No information at all
    1 = No ADS-B Emitter Category Information
    2 = Light (< 15500 lbs)
    3 = Small (15500 to 75000 lbs)
    4 = Large (75000 to 300000 lbs)
    5 = High Vortex Large (aircraft such as B-757)
    6 = Heavy (> 300000 lbs)
    7 = High Performance (> 5g acceleration and 400 kts)
    8 = Rotorcraft
    9 = Glider / sailplane
    10 = Lighter-than-air
    11 = Parachutist / Skydiver
    12 = Ultralight / hang-glider / paraglider
    13 = Reserved
    14 = Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    15 = Space / Trans-atmospheric vehicle
    16 = Surface Vehicle – Emergency Vehicle
    17 = Surface Vehicle – Service Vehicle
    18 = Point Obstacle (includes tethered balloons)
    19 = Cluster Obstacle
    20 = Line Obstacle
