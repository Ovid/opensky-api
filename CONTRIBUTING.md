# Bug Fixes and Typos

For minor fixes, you can [open an
issue](https://github.com/Ovid/opensky-api/issues), but a pull request
(with tests, if appropriate) is very welcome.

I do not accept patches. I've found them too much of a pain to apply.

# New Features

If you would like a feature added, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/Ovid/opensky-api/issues) first so we can discuss
it.

# Changes

Please add an entry to the `Changes` file for anything you do. That includes
your name or handle. You should be acknowledged for your work.

Also, do not edit the `Makefile.pl`. It's auto-generated from the `dist.ini`
file and your changes will be overwritten.
